My name is Martin Savage. Born in [Sainte-Marthe-sur-le-Lac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sainte-Marthe-sur-le-Lac,_Quebec), I lived a very happy childhood. Then I went to school (up to [Universit√© de Sherbrooke](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/about/)), where I learned to read, write and count.

I started programming as a young teen and as far as I know, have done research ever since. QED is the sum of this research.

I have a lovely wife, two great kids and an artist stepdaughter.
