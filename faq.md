# Who are you?

My name is Martin Savage. I lived a very happy childhood in [Sainte-Marthe-sur-le-Lac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sainte-Marthe-sur-le-Lac,_Quebec). Then I went to school (up to B.Sc. [Universit√© de Sherbrooke](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/about/)) where I learned to read, write and count.

I started programming as a young teen and as far as I remember, have done personal research on programming ever since.

QED is the culmination of this research. I started developing it in 2015.

I have a lovely wife, two great kids and an artist stepdaughter.

# Are you working full-time on developing QED?

No. Although QED is my absolute professional passion programming project, I can't afford working full time on it. So I do have a full-time job but off-hours, I work as much as I can on QED and am open to options (like Donate), based upon the feedback and level of interest from people. One reason I published this website is to find contributors helping me finish the coding so we can offer a great product to developers.
