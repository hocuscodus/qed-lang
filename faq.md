# May I download QED? If not, when will QED be released?

Not now. I have to finish parts of QED in order to be used by the community. I also want to confirm design decisions to ensure they are right. This is one reason this website has been published: to allow people to try QED and provide feedback, by telling what they like now and what they would like to have in the future.

In any case though, I would like to release QED somewhere in Q1 2019.

# Who are you?

My name is Martin Savage. My background story is pretty common. I grew up in [Sainte-Marthe-sur-le-Lac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sainte-Marthe-sur-le-Lac,_Quebec) where I had a very happy childhood. Then I went to school where I learned to read, write and count.

I started programming as a young teen and as far as I recall, have done personal research on programming ever since.

QED is the culmination of this research. I started developing it in 2015.

I have a lovely wife, two great kids and an artist stepdaughter.

# Are you working full-time on QED?

No. Although QED is my professional labor of love, I can't afford working full time on it. So I have a daily job but off-hours, I work as much as I can on QED and am open to options (like Donate), based upon the feedback and level of interest from people. Another reason I published this website is to find contributors helping me finish the coding so we can offer a great product to developers.
