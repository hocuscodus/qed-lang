# Who are you?

My name is Martin Savage. I lived a very happy childhood in [Sainte-Marthe-sur-le-Lac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sainte-Marthe-sur-le-Lac,_Quebec). Then I went to school (up to B.Sc. [Universit√© de Sherbrooke](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/about/)), where I learned to read, write and count.

I started programming as a young teen and as far as I know, have done personal research on programming ever since.

QED is the culmination of this research. I started developing it in 2015.

I have a lovely wife, two great kids and an artist stepdaughter.
