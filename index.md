Welcome to the QED programming language. I hope you will enjoy discovering it.

QED is a next-generation programming language that shines in designing complex graphical user interfaces the simple way. Its parallel business logic/GUI coding paradigm offers unequaled binding power, which reduces considerably the lines of code required to develop a GUI application.

QED runs in both native and web environments, without changing a single line of code.

You may take a look at the [examples](http://qed-lang.org/demos) or, if you want to know how it works, the [quick tutorial](http://qed-lang.org/qedintro).

This site is still in its early state, so check it out often to get more documentation and good news!
