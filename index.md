Welcome to the QED programming language. I hope you will enjoy discovering it.

QED is a next-generation programming language that shines in designing complex graphical user interfaces the simple way. Its parallel GUI/business logic (GUI/BL - or guible) coding paradigm offers unequaled binding power, which considerably reduces the lines of code required to develop a GUI application.

QED runs in both native and web environments, without changing a single line of code.

You may take a look at the [examples](/demos) or, if you want to know how it works, the [quick tutorial](/qedintro).

This site is still early-stage, so check it out often to get more examples, documentation, product download and good news!
